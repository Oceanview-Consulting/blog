<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to being an Old Dominion University graduate, Travis constantly strives to continue building his knowledge of the software industry via conferences, certifications and professional organizations.  He has previously obtained several Microsoft credentials and is an active, PMP certified member of the Project Management Institute. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While software analysis and development have been the backbone of his career, Travis’s real passion is in analyzing and providing guidance on the practices and processes used by development teams.  His dedication to creating not only better software, but a better software industry through advocating for implementation of best practices, well defined development standards, and consistent, predictable software development life-cycles is ultimately what drove him to create Oceanview Consulting.</span></p>
